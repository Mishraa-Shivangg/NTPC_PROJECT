During my internship at NTPC's IT Department, I developed a Python-based GUI using Tkinter to monitor network devices. Key achievements include:

1) GUI Development : Designed and implemented an interactive and user-friendly GUI with Tkinter to enhance network monitoring capabilities.
2) Device Monitoring : Enabled real-time display of device names along with their status (up or down), downtime, and uptime, providing immediate insights into the health and performance of network components.
3) Enhanced Visibility : Provided clear and detailed information about each device’s operational status, which facilitated quicker identification of issues and more efficient network management.

This project significantly improved the department’s ability to monitor network infrastructure, leading to increased operational efficiency and reliability.
